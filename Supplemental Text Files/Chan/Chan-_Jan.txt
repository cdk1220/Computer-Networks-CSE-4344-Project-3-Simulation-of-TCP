What is it? What’s wrong?
 What’s going on?
 Who?
 Silas?
 He’s back?
 Godammit.
 When was I ever anything but kind to him?
 I won’t have him back. I told him so last haying, didn’t I?
 If he left then, I said, that ended it.
 I can’t keep … I mean, what good is he? At his age—
 That’s not our problem. What help he is there’s no depending on. And when I need him most, off he goes every time!
 Oh, does he?
 All right. But I can’t afford to pay any fixed wages.
 I wouldn’t mind his bettering himself if that’s what it was. But you can bet when he starts off like that it’s just someone trying to coax him off with a little pocket-change. Then every winter he comes back. I’m done, I tell you. This is the last—
 Good. I want him to hear. He’ll have to sooner or later.
 Where is he?
 By the stove?
 Where did you say he’d been?
 Probably drunk.
 No?
 And he didn’t say anything?
 Not much?
 There’s something you’re not telling me. What is it? Jan, confess. He said he’d come to ditch the meadow for me—didn’t he?
 Did he or didn’t he? I just want to know.
 I just thought maybe he’d come up with something new this time.
 I’ve heard that one too.
 Sure. I remember.
 Good for him.
 I guess Silas is running the place now.
 A little rest will cure that.
 You never would have known it the way they fought all through July in the blazing sun, Silas up on the cart to build the load, and Harold alongside to pitch it on. I took care to keep well out of earshot.
 Strange how some things linger.
 I sympathize. I know just how it feels to think of the right thing to say too late. Happens every time I argue with you.
 What do you mean?
 Good a reason as any.
 I know, that’s Silas’ one accomplishment. He bundles every forkful in its place, then tags and numbers it for future reference, so he can find and easily dislodge it in the unloading. Silas does that well. He takes it out in bunches like big birds’ nests. And you never see him standing on the hay when he’s trying to lift, straining to lift himself.
 Nothing to look forward to with hope, either.
 Home?
 It all depends on what you mean by home, I guess.
 Silas has a better claim on us, you think, than on his brother? Just thirteen miles up the road. You can bet he’s walked that far today. Why didn’t he go there? His brother’s rich, director in the bank or something.
 We know it though.
 By right, he ought to take him in.
 I wonder what’s between them.
 You’re right. That’s probably all there is to it. I can’t think Si ever hurt anyone.
 He wouldn’t let you put him on the lounge?
 All right.
 Don’t be so quick to say that.
 He’s a tough old goat.
 I won’t.
 You coming in?
 Dead.
