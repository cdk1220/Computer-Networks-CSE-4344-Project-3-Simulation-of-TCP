What.
 Hear what?
 Where?
 How long?
 My brother?
 Why didn’t you wake me?
 It’s really happening.  I can’t believe it.
 Are you? I had a feeling it would happen.  A premonition.  It’s been too quiet.  There’s been nothing for days now.  The factories have been closed.  The roads have been almost empty.  Even the air feels cleaner.  I went outside tonight, there were no lights, no cars, nothing.  Not a single sound of the city, just … quiet.  If you closed your eyes you really would have thought you were somewhere far out in the country.  It had that smell, you know, whatever it is—that smell of spring nights—of fields and flowers and dew.  I heard a dog bark, and it rang out so clear.  It struck me, you never notice things in the city—there’s too much going on.  It made me laugh. Listen, a dog is barking now.
 It’s the sound of the future. [Silence.] I have to go too, you know.
 You understand then?
 It’s my duty.
 You’ll be with them.  They’ll have a mother—that will have to be enough.  I can’t stay behind.
 What?
 Do you want to die?  They’ll kill you just as quickly as they will me.  They won’t hesitate because you’re a woman.
 And what about the children—without you to look after them, what chance do they have?
 What if they die?
 Are you really saying this—are you speaking these words?!  You who have lived for nothing but those children?!  Who have been filled with fear for them day and night?!
 What’s come over you?!
 You want to go with me?
 It’s as if the city were already dead and gone. You’re right, I feel like a kid, too.
 There is no such thing as time.
 The sun rises and sets … the hand moves around the dial, but time doesn’t exist.  It’s an illusion.  Who are you?  I don’t know you.  Are you a human being?
 I have to go.  I can’t wait any longer.
 Comrade.
 Bread—it’s so strange.  Everything is so mysterious and new.  I feel like laughing.  I look at the walls and they seem so, temporary.  They’re almost invisible.  I can see how they’ve been built—how they will be destroyed.  Everything will pass.  The table, the food on it, you and I, this city, everything seems so transparent and light.
 Do you feel sorry for them?  The children?  That they’ve come into the world now?  This time of all times?
 You were my wife.
 We worked.
 We paid our bills at this table.
 It seems so pointless now—doesn’t it?  All that worrying over a few dollars here or there.
 Yes.  He died in his sleep.  He told me this day would come—but he didn’t live to see it.
 Her cry seems so strange now … amidst these phantom walls, while there, below, they’re building barricades.
 Wait.  I want to kiss them first.
 You’re right.
 Yes.
 Well What unfamiliar what strange eyes!  For ten years I’ve looked into these eyes—I’ve known them better than my own—and now there’s something new in them something entirely new something I can’t define.
 Of course.
 I’ll remember.
 I don’t know.
 Well 'till we meet again!
